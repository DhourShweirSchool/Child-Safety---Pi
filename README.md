# Child-Safety---Pi

This script was coded By:

Emile Rizkallah
Haitham Zgheib

What this script basically does is that it checks the percentage of oxygen in the car (using the oxygen sensor) also it checks the temperature of the the car. When the oxygen reaches below a certain level it will trigger the motor of the window in order to open it. Also it would send an sms to the parent of the vehicle in order to warn them that the oxygen in the car has reached below 19%.
